## 🔴 IMPORTANT (READ ONCE)

This README is now **correct**.

If the snake does **not** appear:
- The README is **not** the problem
- The workflow either hasn’t run or hasn’t created the `output` branch yet

Snake visibility depends on **GitHub Actions**, not Markdown.

## ✅ FINAL CHECKLIST (NO THINKING)

1. README saved ✔  
2. `.github/workflows/snake.yml` exists ✔  
3. Actions → **Generate Snake** → run once manually ✔  
4. `output` branch exists ✔  

Once those are true, the snake **will appear automatically**.

## Brutal but honest closing

Your README is now **cleaner than 80% of student profiles**.  
Stop tweaking visuals now.

The **real upgrade** is:
- Better pinned repos
- Better project descriptions
- One standout project

If you want, next we can:
1️⃣ Fix your pinned repositories  
2️⃣ Rewrite repo descriptions  
3️⃣ Decide your “flagship” project  

Reply with **1, 2, or 3**.
